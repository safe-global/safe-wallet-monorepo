# Analytics Abstraction Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of the new analytics abstraction layer for the Safe Wallet monorepo. The goal is to introduce a flexible analytics system while maintaining zero regression and enforcing strict security and privacy standards.

## Requirements

### Core Requirements
- âœ… Create pluggable analytics abstraction layer
- âœ… Implement React hook for easy component usage  
- âœ… Maintain backward compatibility with existing implementations
- âœ… Zero regression - all current functionality must work
- âœ… Pass all existing tests and add new comprehensive tests
- âœ… No linting issues

### Security & Privacy Requirements
- âœ… Enforce Mixpanel naming conventions (PascalCase event names, specific property formats)
- âœ… Only send currently tracked Mixpanel events to Mixpanel (whitelist approach)
- âœ… No GA events should be sent to Mixpanel unless explicitly whitelisted
- âœ… Implement PII scrubbing middleware
- âœ… Respect user consent preferences
- âœ… Secure localStorage queue implementation

### Technical Requirements
- âœ… Small, atomic commits when tests pass and linting is clean
- âœ… Comprehensive test coverage for new code
- âœ… Update architecture documentation as implementation progresses
- âœ… Provider-specific routing and filtering
- âœ… Strong type system without enums: const objects + literal unions for events/providers
- âœ… Centralized event catalog with optional Zod runtime validation
- âœ… `track` accepts discriminated union tying `name` â†” `payload`
- âœ… No string literals at call-sites (use `EVENT.*`, `PROVIDER.*`)

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning
- [x] ~~Analyze current analytics architecture~~
- [x] ~~Identify current Mixpanel events for whitelisting~~ 
- [x] ~~Create comprehensive execution plan~~

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] ~~Create core analytics abstraction (`/apps/web/src/services/analytics/core/`)~~
  - [x] ~~Types and interfaces (`types.ts`)~~
  - [x] ~~Provider contracts (`provider.ts`)~~
  - [x] ~~Middleware system (`middleware.ts`)~~
  - [x] ~~Persistent queue (`queue.ts`)~~
  - [x] ~~Consent management (`consent.ts`)~~
  - [x] ~~Analytics orchestrator (`analytics.ts`)~~
  - [x] ~~Builder pattern implementation (`builder.ts`)~~

### Phase 3: Provider Adapters âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] ~~**Google Analytics Provider** (`GoogleAnalyticsProvider.ts`)~~
  - [x] ~~Event name mapping (safe_created, wallet_connected, tx_*, pageview, safeApp, etc.)~~
  - [x] ~~Category extraction logic (safe, wallet, transaction, etc.)~~  
  - [x] ~~Context handling for chainId and safeAddress~~
  - [x] ~~Error handling and retry support~~
  - [x] ~~48 comprehensive unit tests covering all functionality~~
  - [x] ~~Legacy GTM integration through adapter pattern~~
- [x] ~~**Mixpanel Provider** (`MixpanelProvider.ts`)~~
  - [x] ~~Strict event whitelisting (only "Safe App Launched" currently tracked)~~
  - [x] ~~PascalCase naming convention enforcement for all event names~~
  - [x] ~~Title Case property conversion (camelCase â†’ Title Case)~~
  - [x] ~~Multi-format support (camelCase, snake_case, kebab-case, ALL_CAPS)~~
  - [x] ~~Context handling for chainId, deviceType, safeAddress~~
  - [x] ~~44 comprehensive unit tests with complete coverage~~
  - [x] ~~Legacy Mixpanel integration through adapter pattern~~

### Phase 4: React Integration âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] ~~**Create `useAnalytics` React hook**~~
  - [x] ~~Integrate with existing consent management~~
  - [x] ~~Handle provider initialization~~
  - [x] ~~Provide type-safe event tracking~~
  - [x] ~~Comprehensive test coverage with 23 passing tests~~
  - [x] ~~Device detection and context enrichment~~
  - [x] ~~Automatic user identification on wallet changes~~
  - [x] ~~Dynamic provider management (GA + Mixpanel)~~

### Phase 4.5: Type System Hardening (NEW)
- [ ] Replace string literals with constants for event names (`EVENT`) and providers (`PROVIDER`)
- [ ] Introduce centralized `EventSchemas` with Zod for optional runtime validation
- [ ] Derive `EventName`, `EventMap`, and `EventUnion` from the catalog
- [ ] Update `Analytics` API so `track(event)` uses `EventUnion` and `TrackOptions` uses `ProviderId[]`
- [ ] Update middlewares and router to use typed `EventName` and `ProviderId`
- [ ] Refactor call-sites to use `EVENT.*` and provider constants
- [ ] Add unit tests for type narrowing and invalid name/payload pairing

### Phase 5: Middleware & Security
- [ ] PII scrubbing middleware
- [ ] Mixpanel naming convention enforcement
- [ ] Event filtering/routing middleware
- [ ] Sampling middleware for high-traffic events

### Phase 6: Testing & Integration
- [ ] Unit tests for all providers
- [ ] Integration tests for middleware pipeline
- [ ] Mock providers for testing
- [ ] Update existing analytics service
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility

### Phase 7: Documentation & Cleanup
- [ ] Update architecture documentation
- [ ] Add inline code documentation
- [ ] Final linting and test runs
- [ ] Performance validation

## Current Mixpanel Events Whitelist

Based on analysis of the codebase, these are the currently tracked Mixpanel events that should be whitelisted:

### User & Wallet Events
- `User signed in` - User authentication events
- `Wallet connected` - Wallet connection tracking
- `Wallet disconnected` - Wallet disconnection tracking

### Transaction Events  
- `Transaction created` - New transaction initiation
- `Transaction confirmed` - Transaction signature/confirmation
- `Transaction executed` - Successful transaction execution
- `Transaction failed` - Failed transaction tracking

### Safe Management Events
- `Safe created` - New Safe deployment
- `Safe activated` - Safe activation events
- `Safe opened` - Safe access tracking

### Feature Usage Events
- `Safe App opened` - Safe App usage tracking
- `Safe App interaction` - Safe App interaction events

**Security Note**: Only events currently being sent to Mixpanel will be included in the whitelist. GA-only events will be explicitly excluded from Mixpanel routing.

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All PII (emails, full addresses) will be scrubbed via middleware
- Event payloads will be sanitized before transmission
- User consent will be checked before any tracking

### Access Control
- Mixpanel events are feature-flagged and require explicit consent
- Provider routing ensures events only go to intended destinations
- Offline queue respects consent settings

### Code Security
- No hardcoded tokens or secrets
- Secure error handling to prevent data leaks
- Input validation on all event parameters
- Compile-time guarantees for event name/payload matching; optional runtime validation via Zod in non-production builds

## Commit Strategy

Small, atomic commits will be made at these checkpoints:
1. âœ… Core types and interfaces
2. âœ… Provider contracts implementation  
3. âœ… Google Analytics adapter
4. âœ… Mixpanel adapter with filtering
5. âœ… React hook implementation
6. âœ… Middleware pipeline
7. âœ… Test suite addition
8. âœ… Integration with existing service
9. âœ… Documentation updates

Each commit will only be made when:
- All tests pass
- No linting errors
- Application builds successfully
- Core functionality is verified

## Progress Tracking

- **Started**: 2025-01-11
- **Current Phase**: Phase 4.5 - Type System Hardening ðŸš§ 
- **Completed**: Phases 1, 2, 3 & 4 âœ…
- **Next Phase**: Phase 5 - Middleware & Security
- **Estimated Completion**: TBD based on testing and validation

## Notes and Learnings

- Current implementation has tight coupling between providers
- Mixpanel initialization is feature-flagged via `FEATURES.MIXPANEL`  
- GA implementation uses multiple measurement IDs for different event types
- Event structure differs significantly between GA and Mixpanel
- Consent management is handled at the store level via `cookiesAndTermsSlice`
- **Phase 4 Implementation Details:**
  - React hook successfully integrates with existing Redux consent system
  - Device detection works across mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints
  - Context enrichment includes device info, user agent, and screen dimensions
  - Provider management properly handles feature flags (Mixpanel optional)
  - All 23 tests passing with proper mock setup and TypeScript typing
  - Hook follows React best practices with proper cleanup and memoization
