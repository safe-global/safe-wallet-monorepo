# Security Note:
# This workflow runs on pull_request events and has access to AWS credentials.
# To prevent execution of malicious code from untrusted PRs:
# 1. Trusted deployment scripts are checked out from the base branch (lines 65-73)
# 2. PR deployments use these trusted scripts (lines 128, 136)
# 3. Dev/staging deployments only run on protected branches (main/dev)
