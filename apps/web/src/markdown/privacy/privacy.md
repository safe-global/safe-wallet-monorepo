# 1. Glossary {#glossary}

   What do some of the capitalized terms mean in this policy?

   1. “**Blockchain**” means a mathematically secured consensus ledger such as the Ethereum Virtual Machine, an Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanism, or other decentralized validation mechanisms.
   2. “**Transaction**” means a change to the data set through a new entry in the continuous Blockchain.
   3. “**Smart Contract**” is a piece of source code deployed as an application on the Blockchain which can be executed, including self-execution of Transactions as well as execution triggered by 3rd parties.
   4. “**Token**” is a digital asset transferred in a Transaction, including ETH, ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens.
   5.  “**Wallet**” is a cryptographic storage solution permitting you to store cryptographic assets by correlation of a (i) Public Key and (ii) a Private Key or a Smart Contract to receive, manage and send Tokens.
   6. “**Recovery** **Phrase**” is a series of secret words used to generate one or more Private Keys and derived Public Keys.
   7. “**Public Ke**y” is a unique sequence of numbers and letters within the Blockchain to distinguish the network participants from each other.
   8. “**Private Key**” is a unique sequence of numbers and/or letters required to initiate a Blockchain Transaction and should only be known by the legal owner of the Wallet.
   9. “**Safe** **Account**” is a modular, self-custodial (i.e. not supervised by us) smart contract-based Wallet. Safe Accounts are [**open-source**](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/) released under LGPL-3.0.
   10. “**Safe Interfaces**” refers to Safe{Wallet} a web-based graphical user interface for Safe Accounts as well as a mobile application on Android and iOS.
   11.  “**Safe Account Transaction**” is a Transaction of a Safe Account, authorized by a user, typically via their Wallet.
   12.  “**Profile**” means the Public Key and user provided, human readable label stored locally on the user's device.

# 2. Your information and the Blockchain {#your-information-and-the-blockchain}

   Blockchains, also known as distributed ledger technology (or simply “DLT”), are made up of digitally recorded data in a chain of packages called “blocks”. The manner in which these blocks are linked is chronological, meaning that the data is very difficult to alter once recorded. Since the ledger may be distributed all over the world (across several “nodes” which usually replicate the ledger) this means there is no single person making decisions or otherwise administering the system (such as an operator of a cloud computing system), and that there is no centralized place where it is located either.

   Accordingly, by design, records of a Blockchain cannot be changed or deleted and are said to be “immutable”. This affects your ability to exercise your rights such as your right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”), or your rights to object or restrict processing of your personal data because data on the Blockchain cannot be erased and cannot be changed. Although smart contracts may be used to revoke certain access rights, and some content may be made invisible to others, it is not deleted.

   In certain circumstances, in order to comply with our contractual obligations to you (such as delivery of Tokens) it will be necessary to write certain personal data, such as your Wallet address, onto the Blockchain; this is done through a smart contract and requires you to execute such transactions using your Wallet’s Private Key.

   In most cases ultimate decisions to (i) transact on the Blockchain using your Wallet, as well as (ii) share the Public Key relating to your Wallet with anyone (including us) rests with you.

   IF YOU WANT TO ENSURE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY, YOU SHOULD NOT TRANSACT ON BLOCKCHAINS AS CERTAIN RIGHTS MAY NOT BE FULLY AVAILABLE OR EXERCISABLE BY YOU OR US DUE TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE BLOCKCHAIN. IN PARTICULAR THE BLOCKCHAIN IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND ANY PERSONAL DATA SHARED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN WILL BECOME PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.

If this is the case, you also have the right within the scope of GDPR Art.15 to receive access to the personal data as well as certain other information about the personal data and a copy of your personal data. The restrictions of BDSG §34 apply.

**Right to rectification**

Under the conditions of GDPR Art.16 you have the right to request us to correct the personal data stored about you if it is inaccurate or incomplete.

**Right to erasure (right to be ‘forgotten’)**

You have the right, under the conditions of GDPR Art.17, to demand that we delete the personal data concerning you without delay. The restrictions of BDSG §35 apply. 

HOWEVER, WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS DELETED. THIS IS BECAUSE THE BLOCKCHAIN IS A PUBLIC DECENTRALIZED NETWORK AND BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT GENERALLY ALLOW FOR DATA TO BE DELETED AND YOUR RIGHT TO ERASURE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE FULLY ENFORCED. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT ALL PERSONAL DATA THAT IS HELD BY US IS PERMANENTLY DELETED.

**Right to restrict processing**

You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data under the conditions of GDPR Art.18. 

**Right to object** 

You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data under the conditions of GDPR Art.21. 

HOWEVER, WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN, AS IT IS A PUBLIC DECENTRALIZED NETWORK, WE WILL LIKELY NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT EXTERNAL PARTIES FROM PROCESSING ANY PERSONAL DATA WHICH HAS BEEN WRITTEN ONTO THE BLOCKCHAIN. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE WILL USE OUR REASONABLE ENDEAVORS TO ENSURE THAT ALL PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA HELD BY US IS RESTRICTED, NOTWITHSTANDING THIS, YOUR RIGHT TO RESTRICT TO PROCESSING MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE FULLY ENFORCED.

**Right to data portability**

You have the right, under the conditions of GDPR Art.20, to request that we hand over, in a structured, common and machine-readable format, the personal data concerning you that you have provided to us. Please note that this right only applies where the processing is based on your consent, or a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means.

**Right to object to direct marketing (‘opting out’)**

You have a choice about whether or not you wish to receive information from us. We will not contact you for marketing purposes unless:

* you have a business relationship with us, and we rely on our legitimate interests as the lawful basis for processing (as described above)  
* you have otherwise given your prior consent (such as when you download one of our guides)

  You can change your marketing preferences at any time by contacting us on the above details. On each and every marketing communication, we will always provide the option for you to exercise your right to object to the processing of your personal data for marketing purposes (known as ‘opting-out’) by clicking on the ‘unsubscribe’ button on our marketing emails or choosing a similar opt-out option on any forms we use to collect your data. You may also opt-out at any time by contacting us on the below details.

  Please note that any administrative or service-related communications (to offer our services, or notify you of an update to this Privacy Policy or applicable terms of business, etc.) will solely be directed at our clients or business partners, and such communications generally do not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are necessary to provide the services requested. Therefore, please be aware that your ability to opt-out from receiving marketing and promotional materials does not change our right to contact you regarding your use of our website or as part of a contractual relationship we may have with you.

  **Right of revocation**

  You may revoke your consent to the processing of your personal data at any time pursuant to GDPR Art.7.3. Please note, that the revocation is only effective for the future. Processing that took place before the revocation remains unaffected. 

  **Right to complain to a supervisory authority**

  Subject to the requirements of GDPR Art.77, you have the right to file a complaint with a competent supervisory authority. As a rule, the data subject may contact the supervisory authority of his or her habitual residence or place of work or place of the alleged infringement or the registered office of Safe Labs. The supervisory authority responsible for Safe Labs is the Berliner Beauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit.
