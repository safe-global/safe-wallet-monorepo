# Automated Release Procedure

This guide describes the **automated release process** using GitHub Actions workflows.

---

## Quick Reference

### Starting a Release

```
GitHub → Actions → "🚀 Start Web Release"
→ Enter version (e.g., 1.74.0)
→ Choose type (regular/hotfix)
→ Click "Run workflow"
```

---

## Complete Release Process

### Step 1: Start Release & QA

**Who:** Release Manager

1. Go to **GitHub → Actions → "🚀 Start Web Release"**
2. Click **"Run workflow"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Version:** e.g., `1.74.0` (must be X.Y.Z format)
   - **Release type:**
     - `regular` → from `dev` branch (normal releases)
     - `hotfix` → from `main` branch (urgent fixes)
4. Click **"Run workflow"**

**What happens automatically:**

- ✅ Creates/updates `release` branch
- ✅ Bumps version in `package.json`
- ✅ Generates changelog with grouped changes
- ✅ Creates PR from `release` to `main`
- ✅ Sends Slack notification (if configured)

**Result:** Pull Request ready for QA (~2-3 minutes)

**QA Process:**

1. Find the release PR (has `release` label)
2. Test the changes thoroughly
3. If bugs found:
   - Create PRs targeting `release` branch
   - Merge fixes
   - Continue testing
4. When all tests pass → Approve the PR

---

### Step 2: Merge & Deploy

**Who:** Release Manager (after QA approval)

**Manual steps:**

1. Review and approve the release PR
2. **IMPORTANT:** Merge the PR to `main` **WITHOUT SQUASHING**

   **Do not use GitHub's merge button!** Use the command line:

   ```bash
   git push origin release:main
   ```

**What happens automatically:**

- ✅ Creates git tag
- ✅ Creates and publishes GitHub release
- ✅ Builds production assets
- ✅ Uploads to S3
- ✅ Prepares production deployment
- ✅ Creates back-merge PR (main → dev) for manual review
- ✅ Sends Slack notification to `#topic-wallet-releases` with back-merge PR link

**Result:** Release published, ready for production deployment, and back-merge PR ready for review (~5-10 minutes)

> **Note:** Due to commit signing restrictions, the back-merge cannot be pushed directly to `dev`. A PR is created automatically and linked in the Slack notification. Please review and merge the back-merge PR to keep `dev` in sync with `main`.

**If creation of automatic back-merge PR failed**

1. Create a back-merge PR manualy: `back-merge-from-main-branch -> dev`
2. Review and approve
3. **IMPORTANT:** Merge the PR to `dev` **WITHOUT SQUASHING** to preserve the history

---

## Configuration

### Required: None

Workflows work immediately after merging this PR.

### Optional: Slack Notifications

To enable notifications:

1. Create a Slack webhook URL
2. Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**
3. Add variable: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` with your webhook URL

Notifications will be sent for:

- Release started
- Production deployment completed with back-merge PR link (to `#topic-wallet-releases` channel)

## Troubleshooting

### Version already exists

**Problem:** Version tag already exists
**Solution:** Use a different version number

### PR checks failing

**Problem:** Complete Release won't run due to failing checks
**Solution:**

- Fix the failing checks, or
- Use `skip_checks: true` if checks are incorrectly failing

### Back-merge conflicts

**Problem:** Back-merge PR has conflicts
**Solution:**

- A back-merge PR is automatically created after each release
- If there are conflicts, the PR will be marked with "(CONFLICTS)" in the title
- Resolve conflicts by merging `main` into the back-merge branch:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git checkout backmerge/main-to-dev-vX.Y.Z
  git merge origin/main
  # Resolve conflicts
  git push
  ```
- Then merge the PR on GitHub

### Workflow not appearing

**Problem:** Can't find workflow in Actions tab
**Solution:**

- Ensure workflows are merged to main/dev branch
- Refresh the Actions page
- Check you have repository access

### Slack notifications not working

**Problem:** No Slack messages received
**Solution:**

- Verify `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is configured in repository variables
- Test webhook manually with curl
- Check workflow logs for errors

## Important Notes

### What's Automated

- Creating release branches
- Bumping versions
- Generating changelogs
- Creating and merging PRs
- Syncing branches

### What's Manual (Human Control)

- **QA testing and approval** - Still requires thorough testing
- **PR review and approval** - Team still reviews changes
- **Decision to merge** - Merge release PR only after QA approves
- **Production deployment** - DevOps still controls final deployment

### Safety

- ✅ No breaking changes - manual process still documented
- ✅ Existing deployment workflows unchanged
- ✅ Easy rollback - just don't use the workflows
- ✅ QA process remains human-controlled

---

## Manual Process (Fallback)

If you need to use the manual process, see the legacy documentation in `release-procedure.md`.

Use manual process if:

- Automated workflows are unavailable
- You need emergency access without GitHub UI
- Debugging workflow issues

---

## Support

- **Quick questions:** Review this guide
- **Workflow issues:** Check Actions logs for detailed error messages
- **Process questions:** Contact Release Manager
- **Bug reports:** Create GitHub issue with workflow run link
